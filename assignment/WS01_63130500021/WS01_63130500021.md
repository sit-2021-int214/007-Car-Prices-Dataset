# Workshop 01 EDA: SAT Scores dataset

Dataset from [SAT_original.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv)

**Created by Chinnapak Charoensiri (ID: 63130500021)**

### My Step
1. Define a question
2. Loading Library and dataset
3. List variable name and check amount observation
4. Cleaning data :
     - Remove duplicate dataset
     - Handle out of range and no value with NA value   
     - Change type of data
5. Answer the question 
## Define a question

1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
2. Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
3. How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
4. What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?
5. What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?
6. Which school is get highest SAT score ?

## Step 1: Loading library and dataset

```
# Library
library("dplyr")

# Dataset
sat_score <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv")
```

## Step 2: Cleaning data 
*** ( don't do this step before answer question1-3 ) ***
 - Remove duplicate data
```
sat_score <- sat_score %>% distinct()
```

 - Remove no value of the dataset	
```
#replace 's' by NA value on math_score column
sat_score$math_score <- replace(sat_score$math_score,sat_score$math_score == 's',NA)

#replace 's' by NA value on reading_score column
sat_score$reading_score <- replace(sat_score$reading_score,sat_score$reading_score == 's',NA)

#replace 's' by NA value on writing_score column
sat_score$writing_score <- replace(sat_score$writing_score,sat_score$writing_score == 's',NA)

# remove rows with NA value
sat_score <- sat_score %>% na.omit()
```
 - Change type of data
```
# change type to number on math_score column
sat_score$math_score <- sat_score$math_score %>% as.numeric()

# change type to number on reading_score column
sat_score$reading_score <- sat_score$reading_score %>% as.numeric()

# change type to number on writing_score column
sat_score$writing_score <- sat_score$writing_score %>% as.numeric()
```
 - Handling out of range with NA value
	 - Min  value 
	 - Max value
```
#Min
#replace lower min value with NA value on match_score column
sat_score$math_score <- replace(sat_score$math_score,sat_score$math_score < 200,NA)

#replace lower min value with NA value on reading_score column
sat_score$reading_score <- replace(sat_score$reading_score,sat_score$reading_score < 200,NA)

#replace lower min value with NA value on writing_score column
sat_score$writing_score <- replace(sat_score$writing_score,sat_score$writing_score < 200,NA)

#Max
#replace higher max value with NA value on match_score column
sat_score$math_score <- replace(sat_score$math_score,sat_score$math_score > 800,NA)

#replace higher max value with NA value on reading_score column
sat_score$reading_score <- replace(sat_score$reading_score,sat_score$reading_score > 800,NA)

#replace higher max value with NA value on writing_score column
sat_score$writing_score <- replace(sat_score$writing_score,sat_score$writing_score > 800,NA)

```

## Question 1: How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
```
glimpse(sat_score)
```
Result:
```
Rows: 485
Columns: 5
$ DBN           <chr> "01M292", "01M448", "01M450", "01M458", "01M509", "01M515", "01M539", ~
$ school_name   <chr> "HENRY STREET SCHOOL FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES", "UNIVERSITY NEIGHBORH~
$ math_score    <chr> "404", "423", "402", "401", "433", "557", "574", "418", "604", "400", ~
$ reading_score <chr> "355", "383", "377", "414", "390", "332", "522", "417", "624", "395", ~
$ writing_score <chr> "363", "366", "370", "359", "384", "316", "525", "411", "628", "387", ~
```
## Question 2: Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
```
sat_score$school_name %>% duplicated() %>% sum()
```
Result:
```
[1] 7
```
## Question 3: How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
```
sat_score %>% distinct() %>% count()
```
Result:
```
# A tibble: 1 x 1
      n
  <int>
1   478
```
## Question 4: What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?
*** Please do step 2 on the top of content ***
```
sat_score %>% select(math_score , reading_score , writing_score) %>% summary()
```
Result:
```
math_score    reading_score   writing_score  
 Min.   :312.0   Min.   :279.0   Min.   :286.0

```
## Question 5: What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?
*** Please do step 2 on the top of content ***
```
sat_score %>% mutate(total_score = math_score + math_score + writing_score) %>% select(total_score) %>% summary()

## Question 6: Which school is get highest SAT score ?
*** Please do step 2 on the top of content ***
```
sat_score %>% mutate(total_score = math_score + math_score + writing_score) %>% arrange(desc(total_score))
