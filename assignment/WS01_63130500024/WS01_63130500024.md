# Workshop 01 EDA: SAT Scores dataset

Dataset from [SAT_original.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv)

**Created by Chokjaroen Tancharoenrat (ID: 63130500024)**

### My Step
1. Define a question
2. Loading Library and dataset
3. Cleaning Data
4. Answer to all defined question

## Step 1: Define a question

1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
2. Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
3. How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
4. What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?
5. What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?
6. Which school is get highest SAT score ?

## Step 2: Loading library and dataset

```
# Library
library(stringr)
library(readr)
library(assertive)
library(dplyr)

# Dataset
sat_score <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv")
```
## Step 3: Cleaning Data

- Remove duplicate data

```
sat_score <- sat_score %>% distinct()
```

- Replace 's' with NA (Handle Missing Values)

```
sat_score$math_score <- replace(sat_score$math_score,sat_score$math_score == 's',NA)
sat_score$reading_score <- replace(sat_score$reading_score,sat_score$reading_score == 's',NA)
sat_score$writing_score <- replace(sat_score$writing_score,sat_score$writing_score == 's',NA)
```

- Change score datatype

```
sat_score$math_score <- sat_score$math_score %>% as.numeric()
sat_score$reading_score <- sat_score$reading_score %>% as.numeric()
sat_score$writing_score <- sat_score$writing_score %>% as.numeric()
```

## Question 1: How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?

```
glimpse(sat_score)
```

Result:

```

```

There are 485 observations , 5 variables

## Question 2: Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)

```
sat_score %>% filter(duplicated(sat_score))
```

Result:

```

There are 7 rows duplicated

## Question 3: How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)

```
sat_score %>% filter(duplicated(sat_score))
```

 NA's   :57       NA's   :57      NA's   :57   
```

## Question 5: What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?

```
sat_score <- sat_score %>% mutate(total_score = math_score+reading_score+writing_score)
sat_score %>% select(total_score) %>% summary()
```

Result:

```
  total_score  
 Min.   : 106  
 1st Qu.:1102  
 Median :1170  
 Mean   :1230  
 3rd Qu.:1262  
 Max.   :9096  
 NA's   :57 
```

## Question 6: Which school is get highest SAT score ?

```
sat_score %>% arrange(desc(total_score)) %>% head(n = 1)
```

Result:
