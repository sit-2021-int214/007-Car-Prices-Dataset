# Workshop 01 EDA: SAT Scores dataset

Dataset from [SAT_original.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv)

**Created by Natthakan Thaweewatthanaprayun (ID: 63130500031)**

### My Step
1. Define a question
2. Loading Library and dataset
3. xxxxxxx

## Define a question

1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
2. Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
3. How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
4. What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?
5. What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?
6. Which school is get highest SAT score ?

Can add more question ....

## Step 0: Loading library and dataset

```
# Library
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(assertive)

# Dataset
sat_score <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv")
```

## Step 1: Cleaning data

//Removing duplicate data

```
#Code here
```

Result:

```
#Copy Result from console to here
```

//Explain

- list 1
- list 2

## Step 2:

### 2.1. xxxxx
//Content

### 2.2. xxxx

## Question 1: How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
```
glimpse(sat_score)
```
Result:
```

```
## Question 2: Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
```

```
Result:
```

```
## Question 3: How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
```

```
Result:
```

```
## Question 4: What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?

```

```
Result:
```
 
```
## Question 5: What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?

```

```
Result:
```
     
```
## Question 6: Which school is get highest SAT score ?

```

```
Result:
```

```
## Summary
Cleaning the data before analyzing it is  importance
