# Workshop 01 EDA: SAT Scores dataset

Dataset from [SAT_original.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv)

**Created by Natthakan Thaweewatthanaprayun (ID: 63130500031)**

## Define a question

1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
2. Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
3. How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
4. What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?
5. What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?
6. Which school is get highest SAT score ?

Can add more question ....

## Step 0: Loading library and dataset

```
# Library
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(assertive)

# Dataset
sat_score <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv")
```

## Step 1: Cleaning data

- Removing duplicate data

```
sat_score <- sat_score %>% distinct()
```
- Have data that is 's' replace with NA. (Outliers data)
```
sat_score$math_score <- replace(sat_score$math_score,sat_score$math_score  == 's', NA)
sat_score$reading_score <- replace(sat_score$reading_score,sat_score$reading_score  == 's', NA)
sat_score$writing_score <- replace(sat_score$writing_score,sat_score$writing_score  == 's', NA)
```
- Changing the types of values. (from character to numeric)
```
sat_score$math_score <- as.numeric(sat_score$math_score)
sat_score$reading_score <- as.numeric(sat_score$reading_score)
sat_score$writing_score <- as.numeric(sat_score$writing_score)
```
```

```
- Explain
```
  ลบตัวที่ซ้ำออกไป
  ทำการแทนที่ข้อมูลที่ไม่ได้ใส่เข้ามาด้วยค่า NA  เพราะข้อมูลที่ไม่ได้ใส่มาเราไม่รู้ข้อมูลที่แท้จริงว่าเป็นเท่าใด จึงไม่ควรที่จะใส่ค่าเข้าไปแทนที่
  เปลี่ยน data type ของข้อมูลให้เป็น numeric เพื่อที่จะมาสามารถนำมาคำนวณได้
